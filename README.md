# Predict-Bike-Rentals
Our goal is to predict the total number of bikes people rented in a given hour. The data file contains 17380 rows, with each row representing the number of bike rentals for a single hour of a single day. We can download the data from the University of California, Irvine's website. We'll predict the 'cnt' column using all of the other columns, except for the 'casual' and 'registered' columns.
